# Cognitive Mechanisms of Visual Search and the Influence of Temporal Noise: A Drift Diffusion Modelling Study

## Introduction

This study aims to investigate the impact of indiscriminate temporal noise, particularly the movement of both targets and distractors, on visual selective attention using drift diffusion modeling. Visual selective attention involves filtering out irrelevant information to focus on stimuli of interest. While previous research has explored visual search efficiency in the presence of moving targets, the study aims to extend this inquiry by examining conditions with both moving targets and distractors. Drawing inspiration from a previous study using random dot kinematograms, the research employs drift diffusion modeling to delve into the internal cognitive processes involved in visual search, measuring parameters such as drift rate, decision boundary, and non-decision time. By computationally exploring these processes, the study seeks to contribute valuable insights into the influence of temporal noise on visual attention under various visual search conditions, addressing a gap in the existing literature.
